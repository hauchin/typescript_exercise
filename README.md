# TypeScript Exercise

This project contains a set of TypeScript and JavaScript files for practicing and learning TypeScript concepts. It includes implementations for cards, decks, and utility functions, along with their type definitions.

## Project Structure

- `app.ts` / `app.js`: Main application entry point.
- `card.ts` / `card.js`: Card-related logic and classes.
- `deck.ts` / `deck.js`: Deck-related logic and classes.
- `types.ts` / `types.js`: Type definitions for the project.
- `utils.ts` / `utils.js`: Utility functions.
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (if any):

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:**

   ```sh
   npx tsc
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   node app.js
   ```

## Notes

- You can edit the `.ts` files and recompile using `npx tsc`.
- The project is suitable for experimenting with TypeScript features and OOP concepts.
